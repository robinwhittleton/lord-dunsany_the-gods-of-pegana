			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Before there stood gods upon Olympus, or ever Allah was Allah, had wrought and rested MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.</p>
			<p>There are in Pegana Mung and Sish and Kib, and the maker of all small gods, who is MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Moreover, we have a faith in Roon and Slid.</p>
			<p>And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought by the small gods, excepting only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, who made the gods and hath thereafter rested.</p>
			<p>And none may pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI but only the gods whom he hath made.</p>
			<p>But at the Last will MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI forget to rest, and will make again new gods and other worlds, and will destroy the gods whom he hath made.</p>
			<p>And the gods and the worlds shall depart, and there shall be only<br/> MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.<br/> </p>
