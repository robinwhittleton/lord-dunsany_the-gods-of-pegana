			<p>Before there stood gods upon Olympus, or ever Allah was Allah, had wrought and rested <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b>.</p>
			<p>There are in Pegāna Mung and Sish and Kib, and the maker of all small gods, who is <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b>. Moreover, we have a faith in Roon and Slid.</p>
			<p>And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought by the small gods, excepting only <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b>, who made the gods and hath thereafter rested.</p>
			<p>And none may pray to <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b> but only the gods whom he hath made.</p>
			<p>But at the Last will <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b> forget to rest, and will make again new gods and other worlds, and will destroy the gods whom he hath made.</p>
			<p>And the gods and the worlds shall depart, and there shall be only <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b>.</p>
