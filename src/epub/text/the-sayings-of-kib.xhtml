			<h2>The Sayings of Kib</h2>
			<p>(Sender of Life in all the Worlds)</p>
			<p>Kib said: "I am Kib. I am none other than Kib."</p>
			<p>Kib is Kib. Kib is he and no other. Believe! Kib said: "When<br/> Time was early, when Time was very early indeedâ€”there was only<br/> MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI was before the beginning of the<br/> gods, and shall be after their going."<br/> </p>
			<p>And Kib said: "After the going of the gods there will be no small worlds nor big."</p>
			<p>Kib said: "It will be lonely for MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI."</p>
			<p>Because this is written, believe! For is it not written, or are you greater than Kib? Kib is Kib.</p>
