			<h2>THE CHAUNT OF THE GODS</h2>
			<p>There came the voice of the gods singing the chaunt of the gods, singing: "We are the gods; We are the little games of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI that he hath played and hath forgotten.</p>
			<p>"MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI hath made us, and We made the Worlds and the<br/> Suns.<br/> </p>
			<p>"And We play with the Worlds and the Sun and Life and Death until MANA arises to rebuke us, saying: 'What do ye playing with Worlds and Suns?'</p>
			<p>"It is a very serious thing that there be Worlds and Suns, and yet most withering is the laughter of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.</p>
			<p>"And when he arises from resting at the Last, and laughs at us for playing with Worlds and Suns, We will hastily put them behind us, and there shall be Worlds no more."</p>
